## Main discussion
We mainly discussed about time integration methods. In particular about the implemented Newmark method. We could show how the nyquist frequency is influencing the integration. By gradually decreasing the chosen time step, the higher modes are gradually more accurate calculated. We will not implement the Hilbert-Hughs-Taylor method for the upcoming workshop. When we applied a similiar force on all nodes of the beam, it seems like the first eigenmode is excited. 

## Distribution of work

| Person | Work package |
| --- | --- |
| Michael | Pre-work for the second exercise |
| Jan | Prepare the jupyter notebook for the workshop |
| Sebastian | FEMSys class implementation |
| Alexandra | Prepare the jupyter notebook for the workshop |

## Main difficulty 
Indexing of nodes when multiple selection filters are applied. A structured solution is necessary and practicable with a class implementation.
