## Main discussion
We discussed the distribution of following work. The paper has to be prepared until end of next week.
%In particular about the implemented Newmark method. We could show how the nyquist frequency is influencing the integration. By gradually decreasing the chosen time step, the higher modes are gradually more accurate calculated. We will not implement the Hilbert-Hughs-Taylor method for the upcoming workshop. When we applied a similiar force on all nodes of the beam, it seems like the first eigenmode is excited. 

## Distribution of work

| Person | Work package |
| --- | --- |
| Michael + Sandra | 4-6 of HW4 |
| Jan + Sebastian | 1-3 of HW4 |
| Alexandra | Intro + Chapter 1 of Article |
| Sebastian | Chapter 2 |
| Jan  | Chapter 3 |
| Michael | Corrections |


## Main difficulty 
%Indexing of nodes when multiple selection filters are applied. A structured solution is necessary and practicable with a class implementation.
