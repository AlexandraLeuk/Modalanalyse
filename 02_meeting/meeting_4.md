## Main discussion
We discussed the distribution of following work. The paper has to be prepared until end of next week.
Afterwards each part of team worked out given tasks. We discussed the influence of modal basis size, e.g. how much it improves the results. Then the next topic to consider was the proper choice of a vector representing rigid body rotation. In the end the visualization of eigenmodes and the results of modal contributions for harmonic problem gave us better understanding of solved problems.

## Distribution of work

| Person | Work package |
| --- | --- |
| Michael + Sandra | 4-6 of HW4 |
| Jan + Sebastian | 1-3 of HW4 |
| Alexandra | Intro + Chapter 1 of Article |
| Sebastian | Chapter 2 |
| Jan  | Chapter 3 |
| Michael | Corrections |


## Main difficulty 
Some time took the preparation of a vector of rigid body rotation. We enjoyed time finding the best way how to best visualize the modal contributions.
